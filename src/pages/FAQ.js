                      There are two ways to input your daily activities:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <br />
                          <b>Live Activity:</b>
                          <br />
                          First, you have to label your activity into a
                          category: <br />
                          Productive / Neutral / Unproductive
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          There's a Stopwatch for you to track your current
                          activity. When you're done, just press save and send
                          the activity data to our Server.
                          <br />
                          Alternatively, you can youse a Counter.
                          <br />
                          Just specify how long <i>ActivityName</i> took and how
                          often you've done it. The total duration gets
                          calculated for you. When you're done, just send the
                          activity data to our Server.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <br />
                          <b>Manual Activity:</b>
                          <br />
                          Here you can add activities that have already taken
                          place and you have full control over what data is
                          being used (e.g. date / total duration)
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </span>

                        At first, it might not seem very useful, but think of it
                        like a fine wine: the more it matures, the more awesome
                        it gets. In other words: the more activit√≠es you enter,
                        the better the overview about your productiveness will
                        get.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Over time, you'll have an amazing overview about your
                        productive strengths and weaknesses.

                        To get a good idea about how an account filled with
                        activity data can look like, login with the following
                        credentials:
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        While case doesn't matter (e.g. <i>"Watching TV") </i>
                        and <i>"WaTcHiNG tV"</i> get counted as one activity,
                        "Browsing the web" and "Browsing" will get counted as
                        seperate activities. <br />
                        <br />
                        It's best practice to keep the names the same.
