# Make Me Awesome

A couple of days ago, a friend of mine asked me if I could build a "personal improvement" Webapp for him. It sounded boring at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea... and since I was looking for a new project idea anyways, I thought I'd go for it.

Realistically, the App won't have many users, so building a complete Backend for it would be "overkill" - instead, I will be using Google Firebase as a Backend.
Initially, I wanted to use "Directual" but their JSON mapping is completely broken when it comes to nested key-value-pairs. Every JSON Linter on earth approved my JSON string but Directual couldn't handle it. Ever since switching to Firebase, it works as intended.

**Frontend:**
- React
- Tailwind CSS / Custom CSS if needed
- React-Bootstrap
- React-Icons
- Eventually I'll be using ReCharts for displaying the different data in a more visually appealing way

**Backend:**
- Google Firebase + API

**Misc:**
- Will be working with a user authentication system for the first time.
- Design will probably be "Mobile first".


Will update the Readme as I code along.
